                            We are also committed to ensuring the conference is a place where ideas are exchanged, old
                            friends get together, new friends meet and <strong>harassment is not tolerated</strong>. We
                            expect speakers, attendees and sponsor representatives to be professional and courteous to
                            each other. We reserve the right to remove, without refund, ANY attendee (speaker or
                            otherwise) who is unable to adhere to this policy.
